This is my first Odin Project, and first attempt at git. It should be interesting.

The goal is to use the dev tools to copy a website, and learn the following.

1. Two ways to move a div around the page.
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page.
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage.
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
5. Center an element horizontally.
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page.
7. Understan how to use classes and ids to targer CSS at a specific elements on the page.
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere.)
